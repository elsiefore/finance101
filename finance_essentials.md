# Finance Essentials

## Using Financial Tools in Context

1. Calculating Present Value

- Present Value: how much a future sum of money is worth today
  - PV = FV / (1 + r)^t

2. Project Valuation and Business Planning for a start-up

- Net Present Value (NPV): the net value of a series of presetn values, that is the sum of each cash in/outflow discounted back to its present value.
  - If the NPV of a project is positive, it is worth taking.
  - NPV = t = 0 to t = T SUM of CF<sub>t</sub>/(1+r)<sup>t</sup>

3. Calculating Internal Rate of Return

- Caculate the profit of potential investment.
- IRR is a discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero.
- NPV(r<sub>IRR</sub>) = t = 0 to t = T SUM of CF<sub>t</sub>/(1+r<sub>IRR</sub>)<sup>t</sup> = 0
- The calculation is based on the assumption that those cash flows can be reinvested at the same rate as the IRR.

4. Comparison of NPV and IRR

- Unlike NPV, IRR is independent of market conditions, making it less useful.
- NPV of any investment will be decreasing in the interest rate.
- Rate of NPV decline depends on the project.

## Bond

1. What is a bond?

- A bond is simply a tradable loan.
- A bond is traded so that the original owner of the bond can easily sell the bond in the secondary market.
- Often called debt securities or fixed income securities.
- Other features of a bond that are normally stated in advance:
  - The bond's maturity.
  - The bond's principal value or par or face value.
  - The bond's coupons: the interest payments.
  - There are onshore and offshore bonds.
